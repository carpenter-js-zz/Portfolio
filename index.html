          <p class="aboutByPic">
            I am a full stack web developer and coding enthusiast. 
            I recently finished a 6 month web development apprenticeship 
            with Thinkful’s Engineering Immersion program. I was attracted to 
            coding by its career potentials, and fell in love with it because 
            of the infinite creative options it offers. I am crazy about 
            writing clean, readable code. I love collaborating on a project 
            with a team of coders, and adding new languages and frameworks to my 
            toolbox. Javascript was my first love, but Python is my true love. 
            I am most comfortable designing intuitive UI/UX on the frontend with 
            React, with lots of experience designing RESTful api’s on the backend 
            with Node/Express or Python with Flask.

          When I am not working on a project or learning a new technology I can 
          be found hanging out with my wife and daughter, hiking in the Colorado 
          front range, playing video games, or reading comic books. My other creative 
          outlet besides coding is music, I am always looking for people to jam with! 
          I love meeting new people and talking about code, or life in general, 
          over coffee or beer so don’t hesitate to reach out to me through email or linkedin.

              is a web app that makes it easy to plan a big ride by providing users
              access to a Google Map with a bike map overlay that they can draw on, and then save
              that drawing in a database for easy access. I built this app because I had looked
              for a similer tool to use for planning my own bike commutes and could not find 
              anything like this. It seemed like the technology was all there waiting to be utilized, 
              but no one had put it all together in an easy to use tool. So instead of waiting for 
              someone else to build it for me, I made it myself. I wrote the code for Velo Maps
              in Javascript, using React for the front end, Node/Express for the server, and 
              Mongo for the backend. It is deployed and hosted with heroku, check out the
              <a target=“_blank” href="https://velo-maps.herokuapp.com/">live site</a>, or the

                is a language learning app built around spaced repetition, 
                a learning method where if you get the definition of a word 
                wrong you see it more frequently, and if you get it correct you see it 
                less frequently. This method is achieved through an algorithm in the 
                backend which changes the order of upcoming questions depending on wether 
                the answer is correct or not. I built this project with one other 
                programer, Randy Sartor. I primarily worked on the backend server 
                endpoints, Mongo schemas and mongoose queries, setting up authentication 
                with Passport and JSON Web Tokens, setting up the Redux store for our React 
                front end, and writing asynchronous front end server requests. We 
                designed our spaced repetition algorithm jointly by pair programming.

              Helpful</a> is a platform that connects individuals seeking opportunities to 
              volunteer in there community with organizations seeking volunteers. 
              Organizations post information on volunteer events that is easily accessible 
              to any individual. Helpful was built over a three week period in a team of 
              five programmers, with an experienced web developer as our team lead. We 
              worked on this project in an Agile SCRUM environment in which I was the 
              product manager. I primarily worked on the front end, designing and building 
              the UI/UX with React, using React’s new hooks for state management. I also 
              had plenty of opportunity to build out our RESTful api on our Node server. 
              Working on this project, I became an expert in using git and GitHub for 
              source control, and in using project management tools like trello, as well 
              as designing a project and then breaking it down into user stories. Check out the
