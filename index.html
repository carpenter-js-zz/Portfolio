        Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, 
        but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I 
        don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, 
        it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit 
        this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

        Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. 
        That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people 
        who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide 
        if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and 
        become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. 
        She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

            <a target=“_blank” href="https://velo-maps.herokuapp.com/">Velo Maps</a> is a web app that makes it easy to plan a big ride by providing users
            access to a Google Map with a bike map overlay that they can draw on, and then save
            that drawing in a database for easy access. I built this app because I had looked
            for a similer tool to use for planning my own bike commutes and could not find 
            anything like this. It seemed like the technology was all there waiting to be utilized, 
            but no one had put it all together in an easy to use tool. So instead of waiting for 
            someone else to build it for me, I made it myself. I wrote the code for Velo Maps
            in Javascript, using React for the front end, Node/Express for the server, and 
            Mongo for the backend. It is deployed and hosted with heroku, check it out
