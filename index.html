      <h2>About Me</h2>
             
      <p>
        I am a full stack web developer and coding enthusiast. 
        I recently finished a 6 month web development apprenticeship 
        with Thinkful’s Engineering Immersion program. I was attracted to 
        coding by its career potentials, and fell in love with it because 
        of the infinite creative options it offers. I am crazy about 
        writing clean, readable code. I love collaborating on a project 
        with a team of coders, and adding new languages and frameworks to my 
        toolbox. Javascript was my first love, but Python is my true love. 
        I am most comfortable designing intuitive UI/UX on the frontend with 
        React, with lots of experience designing RESTful api’s on the backend 
        with Node/Express or Python with Flask.
      </p>
              
      <p>
        When I am not working on a project or learning a new technology I can 
        be found hanging out with my wife and daughter, hiking in the Colorado 
        front range, playing video game or reading comic books. My other creative 
        outlet besides coding is music, I am always looking for people to jam with! 
        I love meeting new people and talking about code, or life in general, 
        over coffee or beer, so don’t hesitate to reach out to me through email or linkedin.

            <a target=“_blank” href="https://velo-maps.herokuapp.com/">Velo Maps</a> is a web app that makes it easy to plan a big ride by providing users
            access to a Google Map with a bike map overlay that they can draw on, and then save
            that drawing in a database for easy access. I built this app because I had looked
            for a similer tool to use for planning my own bike commutes and could not find 
            anything like this. It seemed like the technology was all there waiting to be utilized, 
            but no one had put it all together in an easy to use tool. So instead of waiting for 
            someone else to build it for me, I made it myself. I wrote the code for Velo Maps
            in Javascript, using React for the front end, Node/Express for the server, and 
            Mongo for the backend. It is deployed and hosted with heroku, check it out

              is a language learning app built around spaced repetition, 
              which is a learning method where if you get the definition of a word 
              wrong you see it more frequently, and if you get it correct you see it 
              less frequently. This method is achieved through an algorithm in the 
              backend which changes the order of upcoming questions, stored in a 
              Javascript built in array imitating a linked list, depending on wether 
              the answer is correct or not. I built this project with one other 
              programer, Randy Sartor. I primarily worked on the backend server 
              endpoints, setting up the Redux store for our React front end, and 
              writing asynchronous front end server requests. We designed our spaced 
              repetition algorithm jointly by pair programming. Check it out

            Helpful</a> is a platform that connects individuals seeking opportunities to 
            volunteer in there community with organizations seeking volunteers. 
            Organizations post information on volunteer events that is easily accessible 
            to any individual. Helpful was built over a three week period in a team of 
            five programmers, with an experienced web developer as our team lead. We 
            worked on this project in an Agile SCRUM environment in which I was the 
            product manager. I primarily worked on the front end, designing and building 
            the UI/UX with React, using React’s new hooks for state management. I also 
            had plenty of opportunity to build out our RESTful api on our Node server. 
            Working on this project, I became an expert in using git and GitHub for 
            source control, and in using project management tools like trello, as well 
            as designing a project and then breaking it down into user stories. Check it out
