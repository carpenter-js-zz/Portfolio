              Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, 
              but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I 
              don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, 
              it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit 
              this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.

              Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. 
              That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people 
              who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide 
              if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and 
              become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. 
              She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
